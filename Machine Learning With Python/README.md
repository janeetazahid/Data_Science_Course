### Final Project

The purpose of this project was to use 4 classification algorithms to see if a given customer would pay back a loan or not.
The 4 algorithms were:

* k-Nearest Neighbour
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression

The data set was stored in a pandas data frame and then cleaned and wrangled. Then the data was split into train and set data. 
The train data was used to train each model, and then the test data was used to test the models and compare them with the actual results.
The accuracy of each algorithm was also evaluated using the following metrics:

* Jaccard index
* F1-score
* LogLoass

**Languages:** Python

**Software:** Jupyter Notebook
